 `Overview`
*  `This project implements a basic network file-sharing application using C++      with TCP sockets. The server can list available files, send files to the client, and receive files from the client. The client can request a file list, download files, and upload files to the server. Basic logging is implemented on the server side to track file transfers.`


*         Aim - Network File Sharing Over Server and Client

#                                 Components

#            INTRODUCTION
`Network File Sharing- Network file sharing is a process that allows multiple users or devices within a network to access files and resources on a shared storage system. It enables collaboration and resource sharing, which is particularly useful in environments like businesses, schools, or any place where multiple users need access to the same files or resources.`

`Logger Utility (logger.h)`

*        A simple logging utility that logs messages to a file.
         Used by the server to log file transfers.
`Server (server.cpp)`

*       `Handles client connections, lists files, sends files to the client,   and  receives files from the client.`
*         Logs all file transfers using the Logger utility.
`Client (client.cpp)`

*     Connects to the server, requests file listings, downloads files, and  uploads files.
`Makefile`

*     Provides instructions for compiling and running the server and client programs.
*     Includes targets for building, cleaning, and running the programs.
    
  #          Compile the code:

*        Run make in the directory containing the code. This will compile both the server and client.
  #            Run the server:

*          Run make run-server to start the server.
`Run the client`

*        Run make run-client to start the client.
#                Client commands:

#          LIST: List the files available on the server.
*  DOWNLOAD <filename>: Download the specified file from the server.
*  UPLOAD <filename>: Upload the specified file to the server.
#                               Note
*   Make sure the client and server are on the same network or use the appropriate IP address when running them on different machines.
The server binds to INADDR_ANY, which allows it to accept connections from any IP address.
#                      logger 
*       The logger writes logs to server.log.
